# Welcome to Eventonica! 

I made this project to practice working with CRUD operations and connection the user's input to modify a database.

## Project Objective:

This project highlights the skills of React, useState hooks and Express.js.

This project utilizes a backend server, created with Express.js. Making calls to an API, displaying the data to the frontend.

## Technologies used

React 
Express.js
Node.js
VSCode 
Tailwind CSS

### Additional Resources



## Installation Instructions

1. Create a folder on your computer
2. Clone this repository to the folder in step 1. 
3. Open the cloned repository in a code editor 


### Environment setup: 

At the root level of your project run the following installation commands 

`````````
npm install
`````````
`````````
npm install dotenv
`````````
`````````
npm install express
`````````


### How to run:
For Backend
1. cd into the folder server  
2. In the terminal type ````````` node server.js`````````

To confirm the backend is connection navigate to the URL `````````localhost:3000/events`````````

For Frontend
1. cd into the folder client
2. In the terminal type ````````` npm run dev `````````


## Future Implementation: 
1. The delete button is a hard delete function and it would nice to create it as a soft deletion with an option to retore the deleted events.
2. Create more tests for components
3. Adds patch http request for favoriting and editing events
4. Make table dynamically render when a new event is added versus refreshing the page
5. Refactor the project so the back end is handling more processing versus the front end
